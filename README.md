# Space Invaders Emulator

Mainly an emulation of the Intel 8080 CPU, but with some additional hardware it can play the old arcade classic [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders). Made with Qt and Qt Creator on Ubuntu 16.04.

For additional information:

* [Hardware specification and code walkthrough](http://computerarcheology.com/Arcade/SpaceInvaders/)

Enjoy!
